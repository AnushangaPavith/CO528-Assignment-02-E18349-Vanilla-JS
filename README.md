# Angle Selector Tool

This is a simple web-based tool that allows users to select an angle using a text box, slider, or radio buttons. The tool provides a user-friendly interface to input and manipulate angles within a range from 0 to 360 degrees. If a user inputs a value greater than 360, the tool will map it to its equivalent angle between 0 and 360.

## Features

- **Text Box Input**: Users can type any numeric value, and it will be mapped to a valid angle between 0 and 360.
- **Slider Input**: A range slider allows users to select an angle visually. The slider is synchronized with the text box and radio buttons.
- **Radio Buttons**: A set of predefined radio buttons for common angles (0°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°). Selecting a radio button updates the text box and slider.
- **Synchronization**: All inputs (text box, slider, and radio buttons) are synchronized in real-time, ensuring consistency.
